### Applications of Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

* The first application illustrates how you can use PCA to project 2-D data onto its principal axes, meaning the two orthogonal directions that explain most of the variance in your data.

* For the second application, PCA is used to project higher dimensional data down to a lower dimensional feature space. This is an example of dimension reduction, a powerful technique that has multiple benefits, including reducing your model-building computational load and, in many cases, the accuracy of your model. PCA can help you filter out redundant, linearly correlated variables and reduce the amount of noise in your data.
